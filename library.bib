  abstract  = {For many problems of statistical inference in regression modelling, the Fisher information matrix depends on certain nuisance parameters which are unknown and which enter the model nonlinearly. A common strategy to deal with this problem is to construct maximin optimal designs, that maximize the minimum value of a real-valued (standardized) function of the Fisher information matrix, where the minimum is taken over a specified range of the unknown parameters. The maximin criterion is not differentiable and the construction of the associated optimal designs is therefore difficult to achieve in practice. In the present paper the relationship between maximin optimal designs and a class of Bayesian optimal designs for which the associated criteria are differentiable is explored. In particular, a general methodology for determining maximin optimal designs is introduced based on the fact that in many cases these designs can be obtained as weak limits of appropriate Bayesian optimal designs.},

We focus on monotone decision problems in which the posterior beliefs induced by the decision-maker's information can be ordered so that higher actions are chosen in response to higher signal realizations. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for decision makers with different classes of payoff functions to prefer one information structure to another. We also provide conditions under which two decision-makers in a given class can be ranked in terms of their information demand. Applications and examples are given.},

Radner and I Stightz (1984, in "Bayesian Models of Economic Theory," Elsevier, Amsterdam) which shows that, under certain conditions, the value of information exhibits increasing marginal returns over some range. Their result assumes that both the number of states and the number of signal realizations are finite, assumptions which preclude most analyses of optimal information acquisition. We provide sufficient conditions that yield this nonconcavity in the value of information in a general framework; the role that these conditions play is clarified and illustrated with several examples. We also discuss the robustness of the nonconcavity result, and the difficulties involved in getting the value of information to be globally concave. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},
